Under the Hood:

React: The application is built using React.
React Router: React Router is used for navigation between different pages.
UI Components: The application uses a variety of custom UI components (located in ui) and potentially a UI library like Radix UI or Tailwind UI (based on the presence of components like Switch, Dialog, Popover, NavigationMenu, Sheet, ContextMenu and the use of cn from class-variance-authority).
Supabase: The project uses Supabase (supabase) for authentication and potentially data storage.
Context API: The AuthContext (AuthContext) is used to manage user authentication state.
CSS: Styling is likely handled with a combination of CSS modules (App.css) and Tailwind CSS (index.css).
Axios: The project likely uses Axios for making HTTP requests to the Supabase backend or other APIs.
Vite: The project uses Vite as a build tool.
Additional Notes:

The presence of use-mobile.tsx suggests the app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
The use-toast.ts file indicates the use of toast notifications for user feedback.
The journalService.ts file suggests that journal entries are likely stored and managed through a dedicated service.
